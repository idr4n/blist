# Bookmarks List (BList)

This is a personal project that aims to make the collection of bookmarks easy and efficient. It is in early development.

I want to be able to easily store any bookmark (a.k.a URL) with its description using the keyboard when on the desktop.

I have a similar workflow to save and find my bookmarks on my machine (take a look [here](https://github.com/idr4n/.dotfiles#bookmarks-workflow)), but I want to have it accessible on any device on the web.

**Stack**:

- React-TypeScript application created with Vite.
- Firebase for storage and authentication.
- Tailwindcss

**The planned features of this app are**:

- Save a URL with its description with the option to add tags.
- Rapidly search and find a bookmark. Selecting the bookmark and hitting `enter` will take you to the corresponding URL.
- Edit a bookmark's info.
- Sort bookmarks based on the creation date or recently used.
- Show a clean and simple UI.
